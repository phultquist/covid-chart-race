# covid-chart-race
I've seen many chart races about the number of people infected in a country, but I think this statistic doesn't fully tell the story.

Instead, the per capita statistic, in my opinion, is a lot better. Thus, I created this chart race through May 15, 2020 with the number of infections per million population.
